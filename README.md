# Sentiment-Based Company Reputation Judgement

This project is a sentiment analysis tool that scrapes customer reviews from **Trustpilot** and classifies them as positive, negative, or neutral using **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** from the NLTK library. The system determines a company's overall **reputation score** based on review sentiment and presents the results with clear **visualizations** using Matplotlib and Seaborn. A minimal **Flask-based frontend** allows users to input a company domain and instantly view reputation insights.
